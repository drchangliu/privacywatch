# Privacy Watch

This project is an ongoing attempt to maintain a public awareness of potential privacy issues of software systems in control of ubiquitous sensors. Autonomous driving platforms with access to a multitude of cameras, Lidars, and Radars are an example of such software systems.

## Apollo

The Apollo system (v3.0 and v3.5) was manually audited. The results are listed in the `Apollo/manual` folder. Additionally, an automated tool was created to automatically scan for new potential privacy info leaking points in newly committed source code. The results are posted to the `Apollo/auto` folder automatically.
