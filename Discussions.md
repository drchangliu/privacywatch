In addition to clang library, there is a source{d}'s Engine that parses source code and then SQL query can be run against it. One of their examples in this page https://docs.sourced.tech/engine/learn-more/examples shows a query that finds all files that call a function named "trim".

There is a module called Lookout that allows you to hook analyzer into it and provide suggestions or make modifications. Its architecture (https://docs.sourced.tech/lookout/architecture) shows ability to post comment to Github's pull request.

source{d} itself is aiming to apply ML to source code to assist in code review/analytics.
